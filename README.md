# mushroom_project
Playground phase. Project for weather-based growth prediction of wild mushrooms. 
Long-term, I would like to:
* Reserach how local weather and climate influence the growth of wild mushrooms (starting  point: one specific species)
* Make predictions along the lines of: What's the probability to find mushrooms today if I go out foraging?

Project parts:
* Part 1: Acquire larger data access (mushroom data, also weather data for some countries)
* Part 2: Exploratory data analysis and viz
* Part 3: Iterative feature engineering, building, and training a sequence model that predicts mushroom occurence from past local weather 
* Part 4: Map visualization of mushroom probability based on local past weather
